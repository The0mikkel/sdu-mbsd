# Assignment 2: External DSL interpreter

## Description

> In this assignment, you should create an external DSL for a math interpreter. To complete the assignment, you should: fix the broken implementation sketch, both the Xtext grammar and code generator file (interpreter in this case). Use the JUnit tests to check how well your implementation works, and report on whether it passes all JUnit tests in a given test class. You can modify the parser and interpreter file as much as you need. Optionally, you can replace the dialog box with a hovering box, as shown in Bettini.
